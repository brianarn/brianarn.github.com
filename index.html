<h1>{{ site.name }}</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Brian Arnold. You may know me from such sites as <a href="http://www.randomthink.net">RandomThink.net</a>, which is my semi-abandoned personal domain. I've struggled with writing on it due to split personality issues (writing about personal stuff on a not-hosted-by-me space feels funny, writing about code on my personal blog feels funny because family and my friends don't care, etc). However, given that <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> supports pages and Jekyll, I'm considering trying to write up some posts over here. Maybe.</p>
<p>Watch this space - or not - hopefully I do something with it sooner than later. Now, to steal from myself, some other places you can find me:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/brianarn">@brianarn</a> on Twitter - honestly, probably the easiest way to reach me, though that username at Gmail also works - y'know, if you like email and such.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.randomthink.net/blog/">My personal blog</a>, which has been stagnant for awhile now. Really want to change that. As mentioned above, struggling with personal vs. professional talk there. I'm open to thoughts.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.randomthink.net/labs/">RandomThink Labs</a>, which is where I drop some experiments from time to time but it's horribly cluttered and I need to sort it all out someday (sooner than later, preferably). Considering moving it to GitHub Pages as well in some way, or maybe using this place as more of an experiments/labs type setup.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brianarn">Photos on Flickr</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/brianarn">My repos on Github</a>, which are mostly half-finished, but you can also find the full source to my labs on there. Mostly JavaScript because that's what I love these days, and likely will for a long time. I suspect you'd have guessed this URL by where this thing lives, though.</li>
<li><a href="http://youtube.com/brianarnold79">My YouTube profile</a> &mdash; about the only video I post these days is the occasional Minecraft server walkthrough, but hey, it's me, so I figured I should link it.</li>
<li><a href="http://colorschemedesigner.com/#3u21Tw0w0w0w0">Color Scheme Designer</a>, with a template I'm considering for my site(s). The root blue is what you see as the background here. That link is set to complement, though I'm also considering triad.</li>
<li>I've been trying to hang out on <a href="http://freenode.net/">freenode</a> more lately - typically in #dojo and a few other rooms. My username there is brianarn, but if you've read this far you likely knew that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Someday I may actually get around to writing more than this page. We'll see. Hopefully.</p>
