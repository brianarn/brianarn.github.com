So, some months ago, I set up a new blog on [GitHub][] because I wanted to
play around with [Jekyll][], and I spent some time making it look half decent.
It wasn't bad (okay, yes it was) and it worked and then I got lazy and haven't
done much with it.

Then a few days ago, [Rebecca Murphey][] wrote up [a post][rmurphey-octopress]
about her recent shift to [Octopress][], which is basically a nice framework
for Jekyll. It sets up some nice themes and uses [Sass][] to make it super
easy to customize the really beautiful layout.

I hopped into the #octopress channel on [freenode][], asked a question or two,
got immediate responses, and basically I was able to move my `_posts`
directory from before into the Octopress setup. It's built to deploy to GitHub
Pages as well, meaning it was ridiculously easy to get the "new" site up.

Of course, I wrote all of two blog posts before, but [Octopress][] has a few
niceties to make blogging a bit smoother. It's very easy to pull in code
snippets for display, including from [gists][]. I wonder how hard it'd be to
make a [jsFiddle][] plugin...
