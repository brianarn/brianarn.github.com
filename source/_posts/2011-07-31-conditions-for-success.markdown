Earlier today, my friend [Andrew][segdeha] tweeted the following:

{% blockquote @segdeha https://twitter.com/#!/segdeha/status/97770601162354688 %}
Don't create success. Create the conditions for success.
{% endblockquote %}

Doing some quick Googling, I'm sure it's not exactly the most original quote
ever, but it's one that really resonated with me. It made me think about what
I'm working on doing with my next [Ignite NM][] talk, which I titled "Doing
what you love: Making a hobby into a career".

I owe a good deal to Andrew and a bit to dumb luck, but in a way, I'm doing
what I am these days not because I went and made my own way, so much as I made
myself ready for when the opportunities presented themselves.

In my case, I wanted to work on JavaScript full-time. I could have gone and
become a contractor or consultant or something, but instead, I polished my
skills. I worked on improving. I read and studied. I spent free time
experimenting. I created the conditions for success such that when the
opportunity presented itself, I was ready for it, and I couldn't be happier.

Are you doing what you love? If you aren't, why not?
